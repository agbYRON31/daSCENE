# daSCENE

To run an app, we need a frontend and a backend. The folder scene_app is the frontend. It's just the code you gave me, but in a file called App.jsx in the src folder. Some of the other files like package.json and index.html are autogenerated when you create a react app, and while we don't have to edit them, they're necessary for an app to run.

I left SCENE_MVP_FRONTED as a file outside the frontend folder if you want to copy paste in AI edits there.
